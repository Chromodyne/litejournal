# litejournal

A lightweight, terminal-based journaling application for Linux written in C.

**Note:** Currently this software uses a barebones `stdin` printing based UI. After getting past the proof-of-concept phase a rewrite for using `ncurses` is planned.

**Disclaimer:** This software is extremely early in development and honestly should not be used in its current form for anyone wanting something remotely feature complete, safe, or stable.
