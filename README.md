# litejournal

This is a quick and dirty terminal-based journaling software written in C for Linux.

**Note:** Currently this software uses a barebones printing based UI. After getting past the proof-of-concept phase, I plan to rewrite it to use `ncurses`.

This software is extremely early in development and honestly should not be used in its current form for anyone wanting something remotely feature complete, safe, or stable.
